PumpkinCandle
=============

Firmware code for the PumpkinCandle DIY kit. Microcontrolled LEDs to emulate candle light. Extra bright.

I will include the fritzing files that I used to get a pcb fabbed.

A statement of interest was made at HackADay. I will fill this out to give a guide to what I have done.
